Important considerations
If the organism is null, then the culture had no growth reported.
In the source data for MIMIC there is a distinct column that describes the test performed, which is not included in MIMIC-III.
Individual rows corresponding to the type of test ordered are not included in MIMIC-III. Examples of this would be a row only describing the type of test e.g. "anaerobic bottle", "aerobic bottle", etc
Store time is not available. Blood cultures generally take days to complete, and the charttime should be considered as when the culture was relevant, not when it was available to patients.

Detailed Description
SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID
Identifiers which specify the patient: SUBJECT_ID is unique to a patient and HADM_ID is unique to a patient hospital stay.

CHARTDATE, CHARTTIME
CHARTTIME records the time at which an observation was charted, and is usually the closest proxy to the time the data was actually measured. CHARTDATE is the same as CHARTTIME, except there is no time available.

CHARTDATE was included as time information is not always available for microbiology measurements: in order to be clear about when this occurs, CHARTTIME is null, and CHARTDATE contains the date of the measurement.

In the cases where both CHARTTIME and CHARTDATE exists, CHARTDATE is equal to a truncated version of CHARTTIME (i.e. CHARTTIME without the timing information). Not all observations have a CHARTTIME, but all observations have a CHARTDATE.

SPEC_ITEMID, SPEC_TYPE_DESC
Specimen which is tested for bacterial growth. The specimen is a sample derived from a patient; e.g. blood, urine, sputum, etc.

ORG_ITEMID, ORG_NAME
The organism, if any, which grew when tested. If NULL, no organism grew (i.e. negative culture).

ISOLATE_NUM
For testing antibiotics, the isolated colony (integer; starts at 1).

AB_ITEMID, AB_NAME
If an antibiotic was tested against the given organism for sensitivity, the name is listed here.

DILUTION_TEXT, DILUTION_COMPARISON, DILUTION_VALUE
Dilution values when testing antibiotic sensitivity.

INTERPRETATION
INTERPRETATION of the antibiotic sensitivity, and indicates the results of the test. "S" is sensitive, "R" is resistant, "I" is intermediate, and "P" is pending.
