Data within MIMIC were recorded during routine clinical care and not explicitly for the purpose of retrospective data analysis. This is a key point to keep in mind when analyzing the data.

There are two types of data in the database: static data and dynamic data. Static data is recorded once for a given identifier. An example of static data is the DOB column in the PATIENTS table. Each patient has only one date of birth, which does not change over time and is not recorded with an associated timestamp. An example of dynamic data is a patient's blood pressure, which is periodically measured during a hospital stay.

This distinction between static data and dynamic data is merely a helpful conceptual construct: there is no strict technical distinction between date of birth and heart rate. However, static data tends to not have an associated ITEMID (as there is no need to repeatedly record values for static data), whereas dynamic data have an ITEMID to facilitate efficient storage of repeated measurements.

Static data
SUBJECT_ID
The following is a list of static data available in the database for SUBJECT_ID in the PATIENTS table:

The only static data available for patients are their gender (GENDER), date of birth (DOB) and various dates of death (DOD, DOD_HOSP, DOD_SSN). These columns all occur in the PATIENTS table.

HADM_ID
The following is a list of static data available in the database for HADM_ID in the ADMISSIONS table:

Admission time
Discharge time
Death time
Admission type
ICUSTAY_ID
The following is a list of static data available in the database for ICUSTAY_ID in the ICUSTAYS table:

INTIME - Time entered the ICU
OUTTIME - Time left the ICU
First care unit
Last care unit
Hospital acquired data
The following tables were sourced from the hospital database, and contain information recorded in the hospital, but not necessarily during the patient's ICU stay:

ADMISSIONS
CALLOUT
CPTEVENTS
DIAGNOSES_ICD
DRGCODES
ICUSTAYS
LABEVENTS
MICROBIOLOGYEVENTS
PATIENTS
PRESCRIPTIONS
PROCEDURES_ICD
SERVICES
TRANSFERS
ICU acquired data
The following tables were sourced from the ICU databases, and contain information only during a patient's ICU stay:

DATETIMEEVENTS
INPUTEVENTS_CV
INPUTEVENTS_MV
NOTEEVENTS
OUTPUTEVENTS
PROCEDUREEVENTS_MV
Externally acquired data
The DOD_SSN (which also contributes to the DOD column) is acquired from the social security death registry. It contains dates of death up to 90 days in the future for Metavision patients. It contains dates of death up to 4 years in the future for CareVue patients.
